# Go Studies

This repo contains my studies with Go and isn't meant to represent proper good practices or quality code.

- `/greetings` and `/hello` contain the very basics of a Hello World application that imports from another package
- `/webexamples` contains a To-Do List application of my own creation based on the snippets from https://gowebexamples.com/
